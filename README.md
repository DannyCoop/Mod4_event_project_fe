-Tien: finish user login (with bcrypt password gem on backend & JWT token)
-Tien: finish event modal & create add ticket button which makes post request to create ticket
-Make user homepage/LogUserIn/trigger fetch events after making new event

-Diego: ROUTING?????

-user homepage with event tickets displayed
-finish map method to display full list of events

TODOS
-Login form does not change active/inactive toggle method when routed...this.props.handleStateChange not a function??
-if we pick category, then hit browse, it does not reset display. Have to change body.state. to null so categories display again; how to do callback when browse is called to reset display
